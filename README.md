## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
git clone git@github.com:Castrokimaru/hospital-management-system.git
cd hospital-management-system

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Set Up JSON Server (Mock Backend)

Run JSON Server to simulate the backend API:

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5001


The data will be served from http://localhost:5001/

Example endpoints:

/patients

/doctors

/appointments

/billing

4. Start the React App
npm run dev


Your app will run at http://localhost:5173/

Example Data Structure (db.json)
{
  "patients": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Brian Otieno", "age": 34, "condition": "Flu" }
  ],
  "doctors": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Dr. Brian Karanja", "speciality": "Cardiology", "available": true }
  ],
  "appointments": [
    { "id": 1, "patientId": 1, "doctorId": 1, "date": "2025-10-24" }
  ],
  "billing": [
    { "id": 1, "patientId": 1, "amount": 200, "status": "Paid" }
  ]
}

## Deployment (Vercel)

To deploy on Vercel:

Push your code to GitHub.

Go to Vercel Dashboard
.

## Import your GitHub repository.

Set the build command to:

npm run build


Set the output directory to:

dist


 ## Click Deploy.

For live data, you can host your db.json via a small Express/Node server or continue using JSON Server locally for development.

Key Functional Highlights

Appointments display both doctor and patient names dynamically.

Reusable components ensure maintainable and consistent design.

Data fetching implemented using React hooks (useEffect, useState).

Modular structure makes it easy to add new pages such as pharmacy or staff management in the future.
